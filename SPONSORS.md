## Zilliz / Milvus

> [!INFO]
> Zilliz has a generous free-tier for their cloud hosted vector database service, Zilliz Cloud. See below for details on how to access.

Milvus is a distributed vector database developed by Zilliz. It is available as both open-source software and a cloud service. Milvus is an open-source project under LF AI & Data Foundation distributed under the Apache License 2.0.

There are two different options for getting started with Milvus. You can choose to use the open source Milvus locally, or use the free tier of Zilliz Cloud:

### Milvus (Self-Hosted)

Milvus is an open-source vector database built to power embedding similarity search and AI applications. Milvus makes unstructured data search more accessible, and provides a consistent user experience regardless of the deployment environment. Milvus is released under the open-source Apache License 2.0 and is a graduate project under LF AI & Data Foundation. To get started visit: https://milvus.io/docs.

### Zilliz Cloud (Free Tier)

Zilliz Cloud is the managed version of Milvus. You can sign up for a free account and get access to TWO Collections that can store up to 500,000 vectors at 768 dimensions for each collection. Find out more here: https://cloud.zilliz.com/signup.

## Twelve Labs

> [!INFO] Twelve Labs provides 10 hours of free credits for all attendees to play with our video embedding and video-language models.

> [!INFO] Twelve Labs' inference platform provides access to powerful _foundation models for video_. Check out their website for more details.

[Twelve Labs](https://www.twelvelabs.io/) builds multimodal foundation models that generate powerful vector embeddings to enable a wide range of downstream video understanding applications.

- _Video embedding model:_ This model, named Marengo, converts videos into multimodal video embeddings that enable fast and scalable task execution without storing the entire video. Marengo has been trained on a vast amount of video data, and it can recognize entities, actions, patterns, movements, objects, scenes, and other elements present in videos. By integrating information from different modalities, the model can be used for several downstream tasks, such as search using natural language queries.
- _Video language model:_ This model, named Pegasus, bridges the gap between visual and textual understanding by integrating text and video data in a common embedding space. The platform uses this model for tasks that involve generating or understanding natural language in the context of video content, such as summarizing videos and answering questions.

Built by developers, for developers, our APIs provide access to these advanced multimodal foundation models, enabling capabilities such as:

- _Powerful semantic search:_ Find exact moments within any video using natural language queries, without the need for tags or metadata.
- _Video-to-text generation:_ Generate deep analyses, video specific Q&A, or general highlight generation for any video content.
- _Zero-shot classification:_ Utilize natural language to create your custom taxonomies, allowing for precise and efficient video classification tailored to your unique use case.
- _Intuitive integration:_ Embed our video understanding models into your application with just a few API calls.
- _Rapid result retrieval:_ Obtain results within seconds.
- _Scalability:_ Our cloud-native distributed infrastructure effortlessly handles thousands of concurrent requests.
