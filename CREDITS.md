### About OmniStack

OmniStack is a developer platform that accelerates AI integration into applications and makes them production-ready by providing essential tools like workflow building, observability, evals, failover, and model deployment. It also provides access to 100+ models from all major providers.

You can use the OmniStack platform to run 100+ pre-deployed models, including LLAMA, or to deploy fine-tuned models.

Using third-party models:
